### Tempus Somatic Test

The Tempus xT test is a cancer genome profiling test that analyzes tumor tissue and a matched normal sample to help identify actionable oncologic targets. The test uses Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) to examine 648 cancer-related genes for a variety of alterations, including: Single nucleotide variants (SNVs), Multi-nucleotide variants (MNVs), Insertion and deletion alterations (INDELs), and Microsatellite instability (MSI) status. 
xT Solid Tumor + Normal Match is a 648 gene DNA seq panel that reports clinically relevant alterations, immunotherapy biomarkers such as MSI and TMB, HLA Class I genotyping, as well as potential germline findings. Paired normal match sequencing utilizes a patientâ€™s own genome as a comparator in comprehensive genomic panels, resulting in a more personalized sequencing analysis.
