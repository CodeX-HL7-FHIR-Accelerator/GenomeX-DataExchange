# GenomeX-DataExchange
This FHIR implementation guide (IG) is intended to organize modeling guidance for consensus among the GenomeX data exchange community. It is not intended for ballot at this time, although it may be considered in the future. Parts of the documented findings in this IG may be merged within the GRIG.
